# React Key Duplication Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
React was encountering duplicate keys for "Project Management" items, causing the warning:
```
Encountered two children with the same key, `Project Management`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was found in `public/data.json` where "Project Management" appeared twice in the same skills array for the "Summer Internship at TLIC" entry, both in the projects section and roadmap section.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Data.json Cleanup**
- **Line 180**: Removed duplicate "Project Management" from skills array
- **Line 319**: Removed duplicate "Project Management" from skills array

**Before:**
```json
"skills": ["Robotics & IoT", "Project Management", "Raspberry Pi", "Home Assistant", "Python", "Project Management"]
```

**After:**
```json
"skills": ["Robotics & IoT", "Project Management", "Raspberry Pi", "Home Assistant", "Python"]
```

### 2. **Improved Key Generation in Components**

#### **Projects.tsx**
- **Before:** `key={skill}` (could cause issues if skills duplicate within a project)
- **After:** `key={`${proj.title}-${skill}-${i}`}` (unique combination of project title, skill, and index)

#### **Roadmap.tsx**
- **Before:** `key={i}` (index-based, potentially problematic)
- **After:** `key={`${event.title}-${skill}-${i}`}` (unique combination)
- **Modal version:** `key={`modal-${modalEvent.title}-${skill}-${i}`}`

#### **PortfolioLanding.tsx**
- **Hard skills:** `key={`hard-${skill}-${i}`}` and `key={`full-hard-${skill}-${i}`}`
- **Soft skills:** `key={`soft-${skill}-${i}`}`
- **Languages:** `key={`lang-${lang}-${i}`}` and `key={`full-lang-${lang}-${i}`}`

## Key Generation Strategy

The new key generation follows this pattern:
```
{context}-{content}-{index}
```

This ensures:
1. **Uniqueness**: Each key is unique across the entire component
2. **Stability**: Keys remain consistent across re-renders
3. **Debugging**: Keys are meaningful and help identify the source
4. **Future-proof**: Handles potential duplicates in data

## Benefits

1. **No more React warnings**: Eliminates duplicate key console errors
2. **Better performance**: React can properly track component identity
3. **Robust rendering**: Handles edge cases with duplicate data
4. **Maintainable**: Clear key generation pattern for future development

## Testing
- ✅ Build completes successfully without warnings
- ✅ All components render correctly
- ✅ No console errors in development mode
- ✅ Skills display properly across all pages

The fix ensures that React can properly manage component lifecycle and updates, leading to better performance and a cleaner development experience.
